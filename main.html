    <div id="disclaimer">Disclaimer: <br><br>This project is a simulator of a typical online casino. This site does not promote or encourage gambling. It is a coding project, it is for entertainment purposes, and it is to raise awareness about the dangers of gambling. This site does not use real money, only fake currency that can be replenished for free. <br><br>In every gambling game, the house has at least a 1% edge over the player. In an online casino, this edge is usually 2-3% for all games. You may have temporary wins, but in the long run, probability states that the house will always win. <br><br>For example, in roulette, if you put it all in on red or black, it's not exactly a 50% chance to win. The 0 and 00 on the roulette wheel gives the house a 2.6% edge, which means the player will only win 47.4% of the time instead of 50%. <br><br>There is no strategy or exploit that can be used to gain an edge over the house or even make the odds exactly equal in any game. The house will always win in every casino game more than 50% of the time. Don't gamble with real money, you will always lose.</div>
